Paths aliases were added using CRACO, following [this tutorial](https://plusreturn.com/blog/how-to-configure-a-path-alias-in-a-react-typescript-app-for-cleaner-imports/)

### Want to add a path? ###
- Add it to tsconfig.paths.json    
  => makes VSCode aware of it
- Add it to craco.config.js   
   => builds correctly
- Restart the server
